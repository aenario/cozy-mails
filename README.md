# Cozy Mail

One of the first applications available on the platform - email client and aggregator.


# How the idea was born ?

Most of us have to cope with a handful of mailboxes every day - personal, professional, legacy one. Sometimes your boss forces you to use their solution, he paid so much for, so you click and open, and click..

Moreover, at some point you realize you don't won your data anymore - it is all hosted somewhere, by a huge, nameless company.


You'd like to have all your data in one place, choose this place, and become free ? And perhaps you'd also like this software to be reliable, well-supported, and ... open source ?

You're right, grab your copy of CozyMail. It's free !



# So, what does it do ?

Cozy Mail will let You configure all your mailboxes via smtp+imap, synchronize the content (mail you marked as read will be visible in cozy as well as in your legacy mailbox, just in case), and use all of them as one via a cozy web interface.

Yes, we paid much attention to make the interface easy to use, nice and lean.

Future versions will allow a purchase of your own domain and remote backup in the background.



# Well, great! So how it works ?

Our stack includes node.js, mongodb, expressjs, railwayjs, backbone, stylus, jade and brunch to start with.

A bunch of top technologies, becoming extremely popular due to their innovative nature... Well, the technology of tomorrow, one would say.
